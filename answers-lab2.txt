1.  Assuming that the following JOS kernel code is correct, what type should
    variable x have, uintptr_t or physaddr_t?
        mystery_t x;
        char* value = return_a_pointer();
        *value = 10;
        x = (mystery_t) value;

uintptr_t.  Given that we set the memory at *value to the value 10, and the MMU
always operates on virtual addresses, mystery_t must be virtual too.
