What we did to solve the exercises:

Challenges completed:

Questions & Answers:

1.  What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each
    exception/interrupt?  (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to
    the same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation
    could not be provided?)

...


2.  Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program behave
    correctly?  The grade script expects it to produce a general protection
    fault (trap 13), but softint's code says int $14.  Why should this produce
    interrupt vector 13?  What happens if the kernel actually allows softint's
    int $14 instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler (which is
    interrupt vector 14)?

...


3.  The break point test case will either generate a break point exception or a
    general protection fault depending on how you initialized the break point
    entry in the IDT (i.e., your call to SETGATE from trap_init).  Why?  How do
    you need to set it up in order to get the breakpoint exception to work as
    specified above and what incorrect setup would cause it to trigger a
    general protection fault?

...


4.  What do you think is the point of these mechanisms, particularly in light
    of what the user/softint test program does?
